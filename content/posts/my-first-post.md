Hi. My name is Elysia Ramirez. I've decided to start this blog to begin cataloging and broadcasting thoughts. My aim with this blog is to reflect on art, share my progress with learning to program, and think through political events. If you're reading this, say hello! ElysiaRamirezHasAnEmail@gmail.com 


My interests include literature (especially modernist literature), music, politics, and computers. I have recently been learning to program and having fun with it.

I'm a Californian-Oregonian west coast supremacist. With any luck, I'll die with friends all along the Pacific.

I have worked as a campaign staffer, but I'm retooling for a different life.

I have a cat named Noboru, named after a character from a Mishima novel. (If you're familiar, you'll recognize the dark humor in the name.)

My favorite writer is Emily Dickinson. I also like these authors: Yukio Mishima, Stendhal, William Blake, Rainer Maria Rilke. I'm partial to Bataille.

My favorite musical acts are: of Montreal, Cindy Lee, and Chuquimamani-Condori. I also love the Pet Shop Boys, Stereolab, Sonic Youth, George Michael, Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Bowie, and Elvis Presley. 

My favorite recent listens are: Citrus, My Love by Guy Klucevsek; I Love You, Honeybear by Father John Misty; some Sanford Clark songs.

I like movies, too. Who doesn't? Talk to me about David Cronenberg.

Curious for more? Email me!
